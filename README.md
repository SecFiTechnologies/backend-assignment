# Secfi backend assignment

## Description
At Secfi we use a microservices architecture. Imagine we want to rebuild our authentication service, and we ask you to do it. The API should allow the following operations:
* Create user
* Update user
* Login

## Requirements
The microservice should be written in Python, and should run in a Docker container. Besides that you're free to choose any framework or library you need, although you should be prepared to defend your choices.

## Evaluation
After you finish the assignment, we ask you to answer the following questions:
* How much time did you end up spending on it?
* What are some of the design decisions you made?
* What do you like about your implementation?
* What would you improve next time?

## Submission
Please fork this repo and create a pull request once your done. You can answer the evaluation questions in the README.

The assignment doesn’t have a hard time limit but we also don’t want to take too much of your time, so try to spend a maximum of 4/5 hours on it. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Good luck!
